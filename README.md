We found that higher income does affect mental health negatively, as wealthier nations have higher suicide rates than poorer ones. The vast majority of those affected being male. We can also conclude that there is a large decrease in suicide rates in younger generations due mental health being more socially accepted. 

Household Income vs. Suicide rates: 

Our hypothesis is that individuals with lower household incomes are at a higher risk of suicide than those with higher incomes because of higher levels of financial stress and limited access to mental health services, which can increase the risk of suicide. 

From the analysis we made,  the correlation coefficient (r-value) indicated no correlation of household income with the suicide rates of a country.

Household Income vs. Mental Disorders:
We found that schizophrenia (r-value=0.79), eating disorders (r-value=0.68), anxiety disorder (r-value=0.85), depression (r-value=0.55), and drug use disorder (r-value=0.41) all have a positive correlation with household income. On the contrary, alcohol use disorder has a weak negative correlation with household income (r-value=-0.37). At the meantime, bipolar disorder does not have a correlation with household income (r-value=0.23).
